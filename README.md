## Basic notation - Learning Notes

- most of the content here will be organized in this manner 
- firstly there will be **UserQuery** ( thats for now - mostly me asking the LLM Public Domain API certain questions)
- in most cases there will be responese from Multiple LLM - as seen below 
- [Omni Response](#omni-response-1)
- [Gemini Response](#gemini-response-1)
- [DeepSeek Response](#deepseek-response-1)

**UserQuery** ---
How can we understand this notation  
Also what are good resources on the internet to be able to read about and learn such notation   
This is the very basics of Linear Algebra 
How to find better resources to understnd this.   

- Notation as below ---

Example 0.1 Let us prove the useful fact that if A, B ‚Ñ¢ X with Ac ‚Ñ¢ B, then
it is true that Bc ‚Ñ¢ A. To show this, we simply note that x " Bc implies x ! B,
which then implies x ! Ac, and hence x " A. This observation is quite useful
in proving many identities involving sets. #

### GEMINI - Response :-

the Google Gemini LLM Public Domain Response is as below

That notation describes a fundamental rule in set theory. Let's break it down.

The notation "If A, B ‚äÜ X with A·∂ú ‚äÜ B, then it is true that B·∂ú ‚äÜ A" means:

If **A** and **B** are both **subsets** of a larger set **X**, and the **complement of A** (everything in X that is *not* in A) is a **subset of B**, then the **complement of B** (everything in X that is *not* in B) must be a **subset of A**.

The proof provided demonstrates this step-by-step:
1.  **x ‚àà B·∂ú implies x ‚àâ B**: This is the definition of a complement. If an element 'x' is in the complement of B, it means 'x' is not in B.
2.  **x ‚àâ B implies x ‚àâ A·∂ú**: This is the key step. Since we started with the fact that everything *not* in A is contained within B (A·∂ú ‚äÜ B), if an element 'x' is also *not* in B, it cannot possibly be in A's complement.
3.  **x ‚àâ A·∂ú implies x ‚àà A**: This is again the definition of a complement. If an element 'x' is *not* in the complement of A, then it must be in A itself.

Therefore, we've shown that starting with any element in B·∂ú leads to the conclusion that it must also be in A, proving that B·∂ú is a subset of A.

### Good Resources for Learning Basic Notation

To get comfortable with this type of mathematical language, you need resources that explain the basics of logic, set theory, and proof writing.

* **Khan Academy:** Khan Academy is excellent for building foundational knowledge from the ground up. The courses on pre-algebra, algebra, and pre-calculus cover set theory notation in a very accessible way.
* **MIT OpenCourseWare:** For a more rigorous, university-level introduction, MIT's "Mathematics for Computer Science" is a fantastic, free resource. The first few lectures and notes cover proofs, logic, and set theory in detail. You can find it by searching for **"MIT 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science"**.
* **"Book of Proof" by Richard Hammack:** This is a free, open-source textbook specifically designed to help students transition to higher-level mathematics. It introduces set theory, logic, and proof techniques from scratch. Many universities recommend it for this exact purpose. You can easily find the PDF online.
* **TrevTutor on YouTube:** This channel has clear, concise video playlists on topics like "Set Theory," "Symbolic Logic," and "Proof Writing." The videos are short and focused, making them easy to digest.

the GPT Omni LLM Public Domain Response is as below

Great question ‚Äî you're encountering **mathematical set theory notation**, which is part of **discrete mathematics** and foundational to **linear algebra**, **logic**, and **computer science**.

---

### üîç Let's Decode the Notation

> **"if A, B ‚äÜ X with A·∂ú ‚äÜ B, then B·∂ú ‚äÜ A"**

This reads:

* Let **A** and **B** be subsets of a universal set **X**
* If the **complement of A** (denoted A·∂ú) is a subset of **B**, then the **complement of B** (denoted B·∂ú) is a subset of **A**.

---

### üß† Step-by-Step Explanation

* **Set**: A collection of distinct objects (e.g., numbers, letters).
* **Subset (‚äÜ)**: A is a subset of B means **every element in A is also in B**.
* **Complement (·∂ú)**: A·∂ú means **everything in the universal set X that is NOT in A**.
* **x ‚àà A**: Element x is in set A.
* **x ‚àâ A**: Element x is *not* in set A.
* **x ‚àà A·∂ú**: Element x is in the complement of A ‚Üí x ‚àâ A.

---

### üß† Proof Outline

1. Assume: **A·∂ú ‚äÜ B**
2. Want to show: **B·∂ú ‚äÜ A**

Start with any **x ‚àà B·∂ú**
‚Üí this means **x ‚àâ B**

Since **x ‚àâ B**, and A·∂ú ‚äÜ B, x cannot be in A·∂ú (otherwise, it would be in B).
‚Üí So **x ‚àâ A·∂ú**, meaning **x ‚àà A**.

Therefore, **B·∂ú ‚äÜ A**

‚úÖ Proof complete.

## DEEP SEEK- Response :-

the DeepSeek (LLM Public Domain) Response is as below 
</p>

The notation you've shared is **set theory notation**, which forms the foundation for many concepts in linear algebra and higher mathematics. Here's how to understand it and where to learn more:

---

### **Breaking Down the Notation**
1. **Sets**: 
   - `A, B ‚äÜ X` means sets A and B are **subsets** of a larger set X
   - `A·∂ú` denotes the **complement** of A (all elements in X *not* in A)

2. **Proof Structure**:
   - The statement proves that if `A·∂ú ‚äÜ B`, then `B·∂ú ‚äÜ A`
   - Uses **element-wise logic**: 
     - If `x ‚àà B·∂ú` ‚Üí `x ‚àâ B` ‚Üí `x ‚àâ A·∂ú` ‚Üí `x ‚àà A`

### **Key Concepts in This Notation**
| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `‚äÜ`    | Subset  | `A ‚äÜ B` (A is contained in B) |
| `‚àà`    | Element of | `x ‚àà A` (x is in A) |
| `‚àâ`    | Not in  | `x ‚àâ B` (x is not in B) |
| `·∂ú`    | Complement | `A·∂ú` (everything not in A) |

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib_venn import venn2

# Define sets
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
X = A.union(B).union({6, 7})

# Visualize (requires `matplotlib-venn`)
venn2(subsets=(len(A-B), len(B-A), len(A&B)), 
      set_labels=('A', 'B'))
plt.title(f"X = {X}\nA·∂ú ‚äÜ B ‚áí B·∂ú ‚äÜ A")
plt.show()
```
*Install with `pip install matplotlib-venn`*

### **Why This Matters in Linear Algebra**
- Sets describe **vector spaces** (e.g., "the set of all 2D vectors")
- Complement notation appears in **orthogonal complements** (e.g., `W·∂ú` for perpendicular vectors)
- Subset relations define **subspaces**

---

1. Search **"<symbol> in set theory"** on [Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)
   - Example: [What does A·∂ú mean?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/702024/what-does-a-c-mean)
